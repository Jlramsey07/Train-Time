This project required usage of great use Javascript CSS and Jquery as well as incorporating the use of a  database.
I ran into issues getting the user input to display on the screen and also being able to properly display new updated times based on Train schedule.
I was able to utilize alot of Google and going over classwork in order to complete each task.
Overall this was a very time consuming but great experience and i was able to improve my skills in many areas.
